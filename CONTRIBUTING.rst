How to contribute
=================

Development happens on GitHub_ - `bug reports`_ and `pull requests`_ welcome!

Releasing a new version
-----------------------

To simplify updating the version number consistently across different files
and creating the appropriate annotated tag, we use bump2version_. For a new
patch release, run ::

    bump2version patch

and for a minor release ::

    bump2version minor

Remember to also push the release tag with ``git push --tags``.

Use twine_ to upload the new release to PyPI.
